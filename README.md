# Automation Pyramid
The automation pyramid is a diagram which is classified into 6 different layers of industrial automated production plants, from field devices and equipment to enterprise management.
## Level 1
Process level with sensors and actuators for collecting production data and executing commands, respectively. On this level, a parallel wiring is typical.
## Level 2
Control level carrying the IT structure for controlling the production process by means of an ICS (typically SPS).
## Level 3
Process management level for the monitoring, operational purposes as well as the recipe management via a process management system, e.g. SCADA.
## Level 4
Operational management level including MES, MIS or LIMS serving as interfaces for the detailed production planning, quality management as well as data collection, material management and KPI documentation.
## Level 5
Company level for the general production planning and order management via the ERP system.

Therefore, the scheme demonstrated through the pyramid of industrial automation organizes the different existing levels of control through the division into five hierarchical levels. The lower levels are directly related to the equipment used in the field, while the higher levels deal with the management of processes, plant and company.
